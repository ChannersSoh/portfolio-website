        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">About Me</h1>
        <p  className="text-gray-800 mb-6">I am an aspiring Junior Software Developer with a background in science and analysis. After spending some time in the scientific field and experiencing a bout of illness, I took the opportunity to reflect on what I truly wanted to do with my career. This introspection led me to pursue a career change into software development, where I can contribute to building complex and sophisticated web applications.</p>

        <p  className="text-gray-800 mb-6">I hold a degree in Genetics and a postgraduate degree in Molecular Genetics. During my time as a research assistant, I frequently worked with computers, especially with analytical software, which sparked my interest in coding. Having previously worked with code and greatly enjoyed it, I decided to take a further step, leading me to join the NorthCoders bootcamp. This experience allowed me to solidify my skills and gain deeper insights into the field. </p>

        <p  className="text-gray-800 mb-6">In addition to my proficiency with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am skilled in various other frontend technologies such as React and React Native, as well as backend technologies like Node.js with Express and PostgreSQL. I also have experience using TypeScript and Next.js, both of which were used to create this website. My strengths include problem-solving and analytical thinking, which enable me to tackle coding challenges effectively.</p>
        
        <p  className="text-gray-800 mb-6">Outside of work, I enjoy traveling and walking. I have visited various countries, such as Japan and India, but I also greatly enjoy exploring the UK. Other hobbies I enjoy include reading and playing games, where I love immersing myself in storytelling. Additionally, I have a passion for cooking; the gratification of making my own food through a combination of research and experimentation provides me with a sense of fulfillment.</p>
